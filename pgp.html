<h1>Pay Gap Puzzle</h1>
<p>Drag pawn-like pieces around to simulate hiring. Can you find a second fair state ?</p>

<h1>Hint:</h1>

<p style="color: #f4f4f4; background-color: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid grey; padding: 5px;">
It's unsolvable. Can you think of the reasons ?

<h1>Solution:</h1>

<p style="color: #f4f4f4; background-color: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid grey; padding: 5px;">
It would have been solvable, if either of the two conditions was true:<br/>
1. Should the job boards have had 10 squares, you'd simply move all the pieces to either one.<br/> 
2. If there had been an equal number of pieces of every shape and color, you'd move
the same number of each to every job board, and the unemployment rates would still have
been the same.
